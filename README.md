## Project Name: Machuuni
<p>A lot of time people suffer from mental health issues for a long time mostly because they don’t have anyone to share it with or they don’t feel anyone will understand. Basically, the idea of this app is to provide a space to let them know that they are not alone. So, Machhuni is a safe space to share personal experiences, advice, and tips relating to mental health. </p>
